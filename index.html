                <p class="infotext">My name is Leland Capps. I'm 19 years old and live in Clover SC. i like to run, hike, hang 
                    out with my friends, listen to music, be outside, and other stuff. im a pretty relaxed 
                    guy, i dont really get mad, im open minded and for the most part i just go with the flow. 
                    however, at this point in my life i am very deterimined work hard and do what it takes 
                    to reach my goals.</p>
                <p class="infotext">for the past year i did freelance web design. it went alright but since i already had some 
                    expericne with coding and with websites, a coding bootcamp seemed to be a good option for me. 
                    from here, i want to complete this bootcamp, get a good job, work for a few years, pickup 
                    freelance again, and when im around 23 i want to take 5 years of to go travel the world. and 
                    by the time i come back i will have work experience, money, satisfaction with my youth, and 
                    maybe a family. who knows... i guess we'll see.</p>
