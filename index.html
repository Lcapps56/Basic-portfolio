                <p class="text">My name is Leland Capps. I'm 19 years old and live in Clover SC. i like to run, hike, hang out with my friends, 
                    listen to music, be outside, and other stuff. im a pretty relaxed guy, i dont get mad, im open minded and for the most 
                    part i go with the flow. however, at this point in my life i am very deterimined work hard and do what it takes to reach 
                    my goals. </p>
                
                <p class="text">for the past year i did freelance web design. it went alright but since i already had some expericne with coding and with
                    websites, a coding bootcamp seemed to be a good option for me. from here, i want to complete this bootcamp, get a good job, work 
                    for a few years, pickup freelance again, and when im around 23 i want to take 5 years of to go travel the world. and by the time i
                    come back i will have work experience, money, satisfaction with my youth, and maybe a family. who knows... i guess we'll see.
