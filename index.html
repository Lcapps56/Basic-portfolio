        <p>I got into computers aroung my junior year of high school and began teaching myself code my senior year. 
            As I learned more and more things about how it all worked I got more and more intrested in it.
            I love the challenge and the puzzle aspect of coding. I started with Python and picked it up fairly quickly and developed a solid foundation of 
            coding basics and concepts(data types, loops, functions, object-oriented programming, etc). After Python I went to HTML and CSS. By the time I 
            started classes for college (was going for an Associates in computer technology) I knew all 
            the things they were teaching. The classes were too slow, too generic, too boring, and it became 
            obvious that school was not for me. So I quit school and began freelancing Web design, Graphic design, 
            and building Wordpress sites to pay rent.</p>

            <p>I recently completed a coding bootcamp at UNC Charlotte and am looking for job. I want to find a 
            full-time job, preferably with a company that builds Web applications. Here, you can see my resume, a link to my Github, 
            Linkedin, and some of the projects ive done in the past.
            If you have any questions, send me a message and i'll get back to ASAP. Thanks for reading.</p>
